Visualisation of the communities in my Facebook personal network

The latest Facebook API doesn't allow you to download your personal network, so I wrote this python script that crawls the site and first retrieves my friend list, and then from that gets the mutual friends of each person on my friend list. I opened the CSV file in Gephi, and followed [this](http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/08/28/facebook-friends-network/) tutorial to create a layout and detect communities in my network. This is what the result looks like:

I didn't realize that my two schools were so well connected! My college community was also really interesting for all the sub-communities I found in it - distinct communities of my batchmates (which could be further divided into girl and boy communities), juniors and seniors.
